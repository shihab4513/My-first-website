<p>In the light of our information, the name <b>'Kam창l'</b> that Atat체rk bears is not an Arabic word, nor does it have the meaning by the Arabic word kemal ['maturity', 'perfection']. Atat체rk's [original] personal name, which is being retained, is 'Kam창l', the Turkish meaning of which is army and fortification. As the <strong>circumflex</strong> accent on the final a softens the k the pronunciation closely approximates that of the Arabic 'Kemal'. That is the full extent of the <em>resemblance</em>.</p>
